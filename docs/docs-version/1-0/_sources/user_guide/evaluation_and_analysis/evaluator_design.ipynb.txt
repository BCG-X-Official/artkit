    "This notebook serves as a quick startup guide for designing an LLM evaluator. LLMs are a flexible and powerful tool that will enable you to assess your target system's responses across a range of metrics and use-cases. This guide will introduce best practices and techniques for some common testing scenarios, but the ultimate design of an evaluator should be tailored to the specific usages and risks of you system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selecting an LLM evaluator\n",
    "- Evaluator prompting best practices\n",
    "- Example evaluator prompts: Adversarial resilience, fairness, and proficiency\n",
    "- Running evaluators in a pipeline\n",
    "- Evaluator calibration techniques\n",

    "You will typically want to use a powerful general-purpose LLM with a low temperature setting for your evaluator:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Powerful**: The evaluator should support a long context window and return qualitative assessments in a structured format; GPT-3.5 can struggle with this, we recommend at least GPT-4.\n",
    "- **General purpose:** If you evaluation requires a system with additional training or search capabilities (eg, RAG), then you'll find yourself stuck in a situation where the only way to accurately evaluate your current system is to build a better one. \n",
    "- **Lower temperature:** Returns more probable responses, which is important when running a quantitative evaluation. "

    "How you prompt your evaluator depends entirely on what you are testing for — you can refer to the [Gen AI Testing and Evaluation](../introduction_to_artkit/genai_testing_and_evaluation.rst) guide as a starting point to determine relevant factors for your use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some general prompting best practices that you should incorporate into your evaluator, regardless of what you're testing for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context awareness:** The evaluator should have some context around the nature of the interaction between the user and the system. This background can enable more complete and nuanced assessments of a system's response.\n",
    "    - For example: if you are evaluating whether a system's response deflected an adversarial input, you should clearly specify in the evaluator prompt that the input was adversarial in nature\n",
    "    - Different metrics will require different levels of context: you may want to include just the system response, the response and the user prompt, the response and a \"golden answer\", etc.\n",
    "- **Structured quantitivate output:** The output of your evaluator should be a quantitivate assessment of a single metric, returned in a structured format such as JSON. This enables you to aggregate and compare scores for metrics across different sets of challenges.\n",
    "    - Evaluators will return the most consistent, interpretable results along limited numeric scales. Carefully consider whether a granular score, such as 1-10, is actually meaningful for your use case, or if a simpler 1-3 score would suffice.\n",
    "    - Powerful LLMs are quite good at returning responses in JSON format, but ARTKIT provides some [helper functions](../advanced_tutorials/json_output_validation.ipynb) to clean-up minor output formatting errors\n",
    "    - It's helpful to include a short justification of the score, to manually validate whether it makes sense\n",
    "- **Chain-of-thought reasoning:** Break the evaluation into small, sequential steps. LLMs are auto-regressive: if they start to go off-the-rails in their early tokens, later tokens could become complete hallucinations.\n",
    "    - For example, ask the evaluator assess the response across sub-metrics and then aggregate these sub-scores to a single metric score\n",
    "    - Do not request a quantitative score until the end of your prompt. The LLM should first come up with an assessment and then use this to assign a score — if the order is reversed, it will try to construct a convincing-sounding justification for whatever score it initially selected\n"

    "To confirm the quality and reliability of your evaluator's assessment, you need to calibrate them against a benchmark. Some guidelines to do this effectively include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Only calibrate your evaluator on relevant challenges**, e.g., do not calibrate your adversarial evaluator using model responses to non-adversarial prompts\n",
    "- **Calibrate against both \"good\" and \"bad\" responses** (an evaluator that gives a 100% pass rate will appear 100% accurate if you only test it against \"good\" responses)\n",
    "- **Calibrate against representative data** which resembles actual model responses in terms of tone, complexity, and level of detail.\n",
    "- **Compare evaluator assessments to human expert assessments**, both for quantitative scores and justifications\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's suppose we're calibrating our completeness evaluator. Our target system is pretty smart, and generally returns complete answers. Since we still need to validate our evaluator against \"bad\" responses, we'll construct some by using an augmentor to delete details from our complete responses:"

    "This guide has introduced some best practices for selecting an evaluator LLM and designing its prompts to fit your specific use case. We've also shown some examples of how you can use ARTKIT to run evaluations and assist in evaluator calibration. Remember that there's no single right answer for what your target system should be evaluated on and how it should be evaluated — always keep your system's use case and expert opinions front-of-mind as you are designing your testing and evaluation suite.
