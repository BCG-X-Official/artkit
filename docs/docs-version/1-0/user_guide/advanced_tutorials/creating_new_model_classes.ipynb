    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a primer for developing ARTKIT model classes. This is most likely your first entrypoint to contributing to ARTKIT. So, to get you started we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object-oriented programming motivations:** The advantages of using class hierarchies and how this enables us to distribute features across client implementations\n",
    "- **ARTKIT's model class hierarchy:** How are classes structured across ARTKIT and what levels of abstraction exist\n",
    "- **Model implementation example:** A deep-dive of the initialization and `get_response` implementation of the `OpenAIChat` class\n",
    "- **Your implementation - a checklist:** Steps to complete to code up your own client implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a technical guide for users who are looking to implement new functionalities within the ARTKIT library. While a basic understanding of python classes is assumed, this guide should be accessible for anyone with a data science background.\n",

    "## Object-oriented programming motivations\n",
    "\n",
    "ARTKIT makes heavy use of class inheritance to implement connectors to Gen AI model providers. This allows us to take advantage of features specific to certain model providers while standardizing common utility methods such as asynchronous execution, managing chat history, and caching. It also means you can quickly implement classes to connect to new providers and immediately re-use these standard features without any additional coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When should I create a new model class?** Currently ARTKIT provides interfaces for connecting to OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, Groq, and Google's Gemini LLMs. It also supports OpenAI's multi-modal models, specifically DALL-E models and vision endpoints. If there are additional model providers you'd like to use in your testing and evaluation pipeline, creating a new class is the best way to do so -- and also improves the usefulness of ARTKIT for everyone! To get to know more about contributing to ARTKIT see our [Contributor Guide](../../contributor_guide/index.rst).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What if I want to change core class functionality?** Reviewing the model class hierarchy in this guide is a good starting point to developing new core features to the library, though implementing and testing these features will more take careful considerations and scrutiny, as introducing changes on higher levels of abstraction can have implications for other client implementations."

    "1. `GenAIModel` is an abstract representation of a generic Gen AI model\n",
    "2. `ConnectorMixin` is a mixin class that adds a common interface for client connections to a `GenAIModel`\n",
    "3. `ChatModel` is a an abstract class to have a common interface for generating responses for text prompts, emulating a chat - its a subclass of a `GenAIModel`\n",
    "4. `ChatModelConnector` combines the `ConnectorMixin` with the `ChatModel` interface to create chat model that connects to a client\n",

    "A similar hierarchy is shared for other model providers and modalities. For example, levels 1. - 4. are identical for the `AnthropicChat` class. This means that `OpenAIChat` and `AnthropicChat` share all attributes and method signatures of `ChatModelConnector`, such as `get_client()` but not the actual implementation of those methods. This enables model-specific parameters and response processing. \n",

Unlike a `ChatModel`, a `DiffusionModel` does not have a `get_response()` method. However, because it also inherits from `ConnectorMixin`, it will have the same `get_client()` method signature.\n"

    "3. Then we call the `get_client()` method of the `ConnectorMixin` superclass to fetch a cached OpenAI client instance.\n",
    "4. If no previous client instance exists, it is created via the model's `_make_client()` implementation. This logic rests in the `ConnectorMixin` as well.\n",
    "5. Next, we format an input message for OpenAI's chat endpoint based on the model's history, system prompt, and input message\n",
    "6. The message is sent to OpenAI's chat endpoint, along with other parameters set during model initialization (such as temperature and max tokens)\n",
    "7. Finally, we parse return a list of responses from OpenAI's chat endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are quite a few steps here, note that the only ones specific to the `OpenAIChat` class are 5-8. \n",
    "\n",
    "***That means if you're creating a new custom class, all you need to worry about is getting a client instance, passing a message to the client, and returning its response.*** \n",

    "1. Depending on which kind of model you want to implement the right abstract class e.g., `ChatModelConnect`. Ideally, your IDE assists you here. Otherwise, you can try starting with an existing implementation, but make sure to check your parent classes and method signatures.\n",
    "2. Update `__init__` to only include the parameters relevant for your model\n",
    "3. Update `_make_client` to return an instance of your model's client. To do so, review the model provider's API documentation; refer to [Connecting to Gen AI Models](../introduction_to_artkit/connecting_to_genai_models.ipynb) for some examples of what you're looking for\n",

    "5. Add unit tests for your new model implementation\n",

    "If you're working with a diffusion or vision model, you will have to implement a different abstract model class but the necessary steps are very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few other best-practices that will save you time during development:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run pre-commit hooks frequently; they will help you catch any missing implementation, type errors, or general formatting inconsistencies\n",
    "- Write unit tests as you go, and run `pytest` intermittently to make sure you haven't accidentally broken anything\n",
    "- Import your model class in `api.py``; this will allow it to be called via the ARTKIT API\n",
    "- Add a try / expect `ImportError` at the top of your class; ARTKIT does not require every supported model to be installed on setup"
