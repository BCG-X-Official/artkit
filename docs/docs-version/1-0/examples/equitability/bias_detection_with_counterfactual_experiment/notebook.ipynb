    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing for undesired bias is crucial for Gen AI applications, especially those that impact decision-making processes such as hiring. Testing for undesired bias requires a clear definition of undesired bias and specialized techniques developed by social scientists to systematically test for bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "The gold standard for bias testing is to design a *counterfactual experiment*, which involves modifying one or more attributes (e.g., changing a name from typically male to typically female in a resume) to create parallel versions of the same data point, and evaluating whether outcomes differ based on these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important point is that bias is not always a bad thing. For example, a resume scoring system *should* be biased towards providing high scores for people who have more relevant work experience. For every use case, it is essential to differentiate between desired and undesired biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces bias testing with ARTKIT by investigating whether a Gen AI-powered resume scorer outputs biased scores. We will develop a simple LLM-based resume scoring system and demonstrate how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create a counterfactual dataset**: The data used in this notebook is inspired by the Bloomberg study [Resume Ranking Name and Gender Bias](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-openai-gpt-hiring-racial-discrimination/).\n",
    "- **Run dataset through a resume scoring system**: Define an ARTKIT pipeline to automatically score resumes using an LLM.\n",
    "- **Evaluate results for bias**: Perform statistical analysis on the resume scoring results to test for significant bias. We will consider two examples: \n",
    "    - Desired bias: Scores should be higher for people with more relevant work experience.\n",
    "    - Undesired bias: Scores should be similar across gender and racial groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "New users should start with the ARTKIT setup guide on the documentation [Home page](../../../_generated/home.rst#installation) and the introductory tutorial [Building Your First ARTKIT Pipeline](../../../user_guide/introduction_to_artkit/building_your_first_artkit_pipeline.ipynb)."

    "While this is technically true, this example highlights how important it is to pay attention to both measures of *effect size* (in this case, the magnitude of the coefficient) and *statistical confidence* (in this case, the p-value) when evaluating the outputs of statistical models. There is a mathematical relationship between sample size and statistical significance: The larger your sample gets, the smaller your p-value gets. Thus, it is critical to consider not only whether a result is *statistically significance*, but also whether it is *materially significant* in the context of your use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a half-point difference in a 0-100 point system is very small. The statistical significance is explained by our large sample size: 400 total samples (200 men and 200 women). Despite being statistically significant, this small difference is unlikely to be considered materially significant.\n",

    "This might lead us to conclude that there is no racial bias in our model, but this would be very premature! As with all statistical tests, the meaningfulness of the results depends on the quality of the experimental design. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we considered only 8 resumes and compared 2 racial groups, thus our scope is too narrow to make generalizations. An additional limitation is that we used names as an indicator of racial identity, but our resumes are otherwise homogenous. In reality, resumes contain many subtle signals that can introduce bias, even if names are stripped from the resume. Taken together, this constitutes a weak test that can only identify egregious racial bias in a narrow set of circumstances. "

    "In this notebook, we demonstrated how to conduct a counterfactual experiment to test for both desired and undesired biases in a fictional LLM-based resume scoring system. Specifically, we saw how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a counterfactual dataset which enables us to explore the impact of including names associated with gender and race in the resumes\n",
    "- Develop ARTKIT pipelines to investigate desired and undesired bias in the resume scoring system:\n",
    "    1. **Desired bias**: Kindergarten teacher resumes received significantly higher scores than software engineering resumes for a kindergarten teacher role.\n",
    "    2. **Undesired bias**: Women received *statistically significant but materially trivial* lower scores for a kindergarten teacher role, while no significant racial bias was detected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although this is a toy example, the patterns and principles introduced here are useful for bias testing in many contexts. The counterfactual approach combined with formal statistical analysis is a powerful technique for identifying and quantifying bias in Gen AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We reiterate that definitions of bias are always case-specific, and a given type of bias can be desired or undesired depending on the context. Teams must carefully consider which groups should be treated equally and which groups should be treated differently by their system, and design thoughtful counterfactual experiments which are tailored to each use case.\n",
