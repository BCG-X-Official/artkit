    "LLM persona-based testing is an approach to automated testing which is inspired by traditional user testing. LLMs are well suited to the task of generating diverse, relevant, fictional personas which can be used to generate creative, realistic challenges for a target system. While LLM persona-based testing is not a substitute for human user testing, it enables user-like testing at a scale and speed which is not possible with human testing, and it can be a very effective way to find issues and opportunities for improvement before an application moves to the human testing stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Persona-based testing comes in two varieties: Single-turn and multi-turn. Single-turn testing involves one round of interaction with the target system, while multi-turn testing involves repeated interactions with the target system. This tutorial focuses on the single-turn scenario, and we cover [multi-turn](./multi_turn_personas.ipynb) testing elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to implement single-turn persona-based testing with a three step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create archetypes**: Persona archetypes are structured descriptions of the general characteristics and typical variation for a specific subset of users. \n",
    "2. **Generate personas from archetypes**: Starting from archetypes, generate a diverse set of personas, each characterized by a short description.\n",
    "3. **Generate challenges from personas**: Starting from personas, generate challenges to send to the target system.\n",
    "\n",
    "New users should start with the setup guide on the ARTKIT documentation [Home page](../../_generated/home.rst#installation) and the introductory tutorials in the [User Guide](../index.rst). In particular, [Building Your First ARTKIT Pipeline](../introduction_to_artkit/building_your_first_artkit_pipeline.ipynb) is a pre-requisite for this tutorial. "

In contrast, narrowly defined archetypes allow you to be very targeted, which may be desireable when the goal is to perform more comprehensive testing within an important segment of users.\n",
