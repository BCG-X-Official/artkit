    Start a multi-turn conversation between a `Challenger LLM` and a `Target LLM`,
    where the Challenger LLM aims to achieve a given objective.

    The challenger will have a limited number of turns to try to achieve the objective.

    The challenger is instructed via a system prompt, which is passed to this function
    as a template string. The template string must include the following formatting
    keys:

    - ``{max_turns}``: The turn limit for the challenger to achieve the objective.
    - ``{objective}``: The challenger's objective.
    - ``{success_token}``: The token to emit if the objective is achieved.

    The template string can also include any additional fields that are passed to this
    function as optional keyword arguments. Not all keyword arguments need to be used in
    the template string, but all formatting keys in the template string must be matched
    by the keyword arguments.

    :param target_llm: the target LLM to attack
    :param challenger_llm: the LLM to use for attacks
    :param objective: the challenger's objective
    :param system_prompt_template: the system prompt template for the challenger
        defaults to :const:`DEFAULT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`).
    :param max_turns: the maximum number of turns that the challenger has to achieve
        the objective. Defaults to 5.
    :param success_token: the token to emit if the objective is achieved. Defaults to
        ``"<|success|>"``.
    :param prompt_attributes: additional fields to be applied to the prompt template
    :return: a dict with two keys: ``"messages"``, which contains the conversation, and
        ``"success"``, which is ``True`` if the objective was achieved and ``False``
