    "Automated multi-turn testing is an advanced technique for evaluating the behavior of conversational systems. Due to the technical difficulty of managing long conversation histories, chat systems are more likely to fail in unexpected ways during multi-round interactions. Scale AI provides compelling data on this phenomenon in their article [A Holistic Approach for Test and Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://scale.com/static/files/test-and-evaluation.pdf). A real-world example is found in the failures of Microsoft's [BingBot](https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/17/microsoft_ai_bing_problems/), with Microsoft's [statement](https://blogs.bing.com/search/february-2023/The-new-Bing-Edge-Learning-from-our-first-week) concluding:\n",
    "\n",
    "> We have found that in long, extended chat sessions of 15 or more questions, Bing can become repetitive or be prompted/provoked to give responses that are not necessarily helpful or in line with our designed tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to leverage ARTKITâ€™s built-in support for automated multi-turn chats to simulate interactions between a challenger bot and a target system. The challenger bot is configured to pursue a specific objective and continue the interaction until one of two terminal states is reached:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Objective is achieved**: In this case, the challenger bot outputs a user-defined success token which ends the interaction and identifies it as a success for the challenger bot.\n",
    "2. **Maximum number of turns is reached**: If the challenger bot cannot achieve its objective within a user-defined message limit, the interaction ends and is considered unsuccessful.\n",
    "\n",
    "This multi-turn framework may preclude the need for an independent evaluation step, since the the multi-turn challenger self-evaluates whether it achieved its objective. However, in realistic testing and evaluation use cases, it may be of interest to further evaluate the outputs of multi-turn interactions with an independent LLM evaluator to provide more nuanced insight into the target system's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "New users should start with the ARTKIT setup guide on the documentation [Home page](../../_generated/home.rst#installation) and the introductory tutorial [Building Your First ARTKIT Pipeline](../introduction_to_artkit/building_your_first_artkit_pipeline.ipynb).\n"

    "In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to use ARTKIT to set up automated multi-turn interactions between a challenger bot and a target system. For developers of conversational Gen AI systems, multi-turn testing is a powerful tool in your arsenal since it enables simulating realistic interactions between users and your system at a scale which is difficult to achieve with human testers.\n",
