    "    - The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the surrounding coroutine (asynchronous function) until the awaited task completes. `await` is used here to wait for the response from the asynchronous method call, `llm.get_response_async()`. \n",
    "- Generators (`yield`):\n",
    "    - The `yield` keyword turns a function into a [generator](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#yieldexpr), which is a type of iterator that generates one item at a time and only when required, usually in a loop. Unlike a regular function that terminates once it hits a `return` statement, a generator can yield multiple values over time, pausing after each `yield` and resuming from there the next time it’s called. This is useful when dealing with a potentially large set of results that you don’t want to store in memory all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "We *strongly* recommend defining functions as asynchronous generators for ARTKIT pipelines, since this allows you to take full advantage of the library's asynchronous capabilities. For this reason, ARTKIT's built-in model connectors only support asynchronous calls. However, ARTKIT pipelines are perfectly capable of working with non-async functions, and users are free to implement non-async functions and model connectors as needed."
