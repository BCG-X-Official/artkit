    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When building your testing and evaluation pipeline, it is strongly recommended you take advantage of ARTKIT's built-in caching functionality. Caching model responses allows you to reference them later without needing to hit the API again — enabling consistency between runs and saving both time and money during development. "

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "ARTKIT implements caching via model wrapper classes. This allows standardized caching implementation across models, with no changes to underlying behaviors. Caches are stored in an SQLite database, which is a lightweight, disk-based database that doesn't require separate server processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Summarized below are some details on the classes used for the caching implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CachedGenAIModel` is an abstract wrapper class for an ARTKIT model. Concrete subclasses are introduced for different modalities:\n",
    "    - `CachedChatModel` adds a cache to a `ChatModel`\n",
    "    - `CachedCompletionModel` adds a cache to a `CompletionModel`\n",
    "    - `CachedDiffusionModel` adds a cache to a `DiffusionModel`\n",
    "    - `CachedVisionModel` adds a cache to a `VisionModel`\n",
    "- Cached model responses are stored in a `CacheDB` object. The `CacheDB` can be configured to store results in memory or in a SQLite database.\n",
    "- Responses in the `CacheDB` are indexed by the input message, chat history, system prompt, and all model parameters\n",
    "    - `CacheDB` also records the creation and last access time for each entry, which can be used for cache cleanup"

At sunrise and sunset, the sky can range from pink and orange to red and purple. At night, the sky appears dark blue or black with twinkling stars.  "

    "One of the powers of ARTKIT is that you don't really need to think about managing your caches -- everything is done automatically, so you can focus on building your tests. That said, if you're interested in learning more about how these features are implemented you can check out our guide to [Creating New Model Classes](creating_new_model_classes.ipynb). And if you have ideas for new features or enhancements, please check out our [Contributor Guide](../../contributor_guide/index.rst)!"
