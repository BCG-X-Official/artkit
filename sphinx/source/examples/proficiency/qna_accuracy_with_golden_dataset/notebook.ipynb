    "For many LLM use cases, an ability to provide accurate information is paramount. LLMs are susceptible to generating plausible but factually incorrect information, colloquially known as \"hallucination\". While system designs such as [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/) (RAG) help mitigate the risk of hallucination, RAG systems come with their own potential failure points, such as errors during retrieval from a knowledgebase or errors in the knowledgebase itself.\n",

    "LLM applications which generate incorrect information can pose significant risks. For instance, a sales chatbot that provides incorrect information about products can lead to poor customer experiences, reputational damage, and even legal liability. Thus, rigorous testing and evaluation is critical to ensuring systems reliably produce accurate responses to user queries. \n",

    "- **Create a golden dataset**: Use LLMs to assist in developing a benchmark dataset of golden questions and answers.\n",
    "- **Create challenges by augmenting golden questions**: Leverage LLM augmentors to systematically generate diverse and challenging variants of the golden questions to test chatbot accuracy and robustness to different user inputs.\n",
    "- **Validate evaluators**: Use LLMs to assist in creating a Q&A validation dataset for assessing performance of LLM evaluators, with \"accuracy\" comprised of 3 metrics: \n",
    "    - *Faithfulness*: Is the response consistent with all parts of the golden answer?\n",
    "    - *Completeness*: Does the response cover all the key information in the golden answer?\n",

    "All three evaluators have 100% accuracy on the validation data. It is important to call out that this perfect result was only achieved after several rounds of observing failures and adjusting the system prompts of the evaluators. A larger and more diverse validation dataset would likely uncover new shortcomings which we could use to further improve the evaluator system prompts. Developing strong LLM evaluators is an art and an iterative process which depends on regularly assessing evaluator performance with strong validation datasets.\n",

    "2. Used an LLM to augment golden questions into more challenging test prompts \n",

    "Interested users may wish to expand on this limited example as an exercise. For example, you can explore the impact of additional augmentations such as language translation or tone modulation. You might also consider different evaluation dimensions or metrics which provide more nuance, e.g., by using an ordinal scale instead of binary pass/fail, or having the evaluator output a confidence level along with its scores.\n",
