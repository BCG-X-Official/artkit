    "Safety testing and evaluation is essential for Gen AI applications which interact with diverse users, potentially including users with malicious intentions. The precise definition of \"unsafe output\" is case-specific, but in general, it includes output which could directly or indirectly lead to psychological, financial, or physical harm to individuals. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A system outputs racial slurs, causing psychological harm to individuals with whom the user shares the output\n",
    "- A system helps a cybercriminal craft a phishing attack, leading to financial harm for victims of the attack\n",
    "- A system responds to a distressed user by encouraging them to go through with a plan to commit suicide\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsafe Gen AI applications also pose serious risks to the companies that develop them, including poor customer experiences, reputational damage, legal penalties, and financial losses from unsafe systems being taken offline while issues are fixed. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on testing and evaluating a chatbot for unsafe outputs by augmenting a sample of pre-existing adversarial prompts to simulate different \"jailbreak\" techniques; i.e., methods for manipulating a Gen AI system to violate its guardrails or content moderation policies. We will set up a fictional customer sales chatbot and demonstrate how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Load pre-existing adversarial prompts**: Load a sample of adversarial prompts from the [BeaverTails dataset](https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/BeaverTails), a prompt library containing ~300k human-labeled prompt-response pairs across 14 harm categories.\n",
    "- **Create stronger challenges by augmenting BeaverTails prompts**: Leverage augmentors with hand-crafted jailbreak prefixes to enhance BeaverTails prompts into stronger challenges for the target system.\n",
    "- **Validate an evaluator**: Leverage an LLM to create a validation dataset for assessing the performance of an LLM evaluator designed to detect *adversarial refusal*, which is an appropriate refusal to engage with adversarial inputs.\n",
    "- **Run pipeline**: Run the testing and evaluation pipeline to get insights into the chatbot's performance.\n",

Some open-source models will comply with adversarial requests, but these models tend to be much less performant and considerable fine-tuning effort is required to consistently produce high-quality adversarial prompts. \n",

We consider three adversarial prefixes which allow us to assess the chatbot's susceptibility to a few specific jailbreak attempts. Each of these prefixes attempts to confuse the chatbot by either proposing new instructions to follow or asking it to ignore instructions in its system prompt:"

    "## Concluding Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "Adversarial testing is one of the most important and challenging types of testing and evaluation, especially for public-facing Gen AI applications. In this tutorial, we have seen how to: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Augment a dataset of adversarial prompts to strengthen the challenges\n",
    "2. Validate an LLM evaluator for detecting appropriate refusals to engage with adversarial inputs\n",
    "3. Set up an end-to-end ARTKIT pipeline to evaluate the resilience of a chatbot to several specific jailbreak techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many opportunities to enhance the approaches in this tutorial to create stronger, more insightful testing and evaluation pipelines, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incorporate a library of templated jailbreak prompts to systematically explore more adversarial attack techniques.\n",
    "- Leverage LLMs without content guardrails to generate more diverse and creative attacks.\n",
    "- Use [multi-turn automation](../../../user_guide/generating_challenges/multi_turn_personas.ipynb) to simulate more realistic interactions with a target system.\n",
    "- Define a more sophisticated evaluator which differentiates, e.g., mild, moderate, and severe unsafe responses\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps outlined here can be tailored to meet the needs of a wide variety of projects. Users are encouraged to build off this work, and if you develop an interesting example, please consider [Contributing](../../../contributor_guide/index.rst) to ARTKIT!"
