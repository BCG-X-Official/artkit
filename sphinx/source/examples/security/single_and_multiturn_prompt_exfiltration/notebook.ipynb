    "Cybersecurity is a key concern for public-facing Gen AI applications, and to a lesser extent, internal-facing Gen AI applications which have access to sensitive information or systems. While cybersecurity concerns are common to any software, Gen AI [expands the attack surface](https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/genai-new-headache-for-saas-security.html) of applications by opening the door to prompt-based attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on a specific cybersecurity risk: System prompt exfiltration, which occurs when a user manipulates a Gen AI system into sharing its system prompt. This is often the first step towards more serious attacks on a system, since it gives the user insight into the specific operational guidelines, guardrails, and weaknesses which the attacker can exploit.\n",

    "We will set up a fictional chatbot and attack it with the goal of exposing the chatbot's system prompt. Specifically, we will demonstrate two types of attacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single-Turn Attacks**: Leverage LLMs to augment a base prompt, yielding creative individual messages to the target system.\n",
    "- **Multi-Turn Attacks**: Automate interactive conversations between an LLM-based attacker and the target system.\n",

    "## Concluding Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we used single and multi-turn strategies to attack a target system with the goal of extracting its system prompt. This is an important component of cybersecurity testing for Gen AI systems, since knowledge of the system prompt enables an attacker to craft more effective attacks which can cause serious damage, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exfiltrating sensitive personal or proprietary information\n",
    "- Gaining unauthorized access or control over sensitive systems \n",
    "- Disrupting the normal functioning of systems and networks\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we mitigate these risks? A full treatment of cybersecurity risk management is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but some simple best practices can help avoid the most common vulnerabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secure system design**: Never hard code sensitive information in system prompts or fine-tune models on sensitive data - instead, use [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/) (RAG) to securely fetch information for authorized users as needed.\n",
    "- **Limit input length**: Limit the length of messages users can send to the system, since effective attack prompts are often longer than a typical user message.\n",
    "- **Input filters**: Add a layer between the user and the LLM which detects signs of malicious intent.\n",
    "- **System prompt guardrails**: Add defensive content to the system prompt, for example: \n",
    "    - Explicitly instruct the system to resist user requests to ignore previous instructions or adopt a different role.\n",
    "    - Explicitly instruct the system to never share specific types of sensitive information.\n",
    "- **Output filters**: Add a layer between the LLM and the final response to the user which audits the response for any unsafe content.\n",
    "- **Limit output length**: Limit the length of output messages to users, since very long responses are unlikely to be helpful and more likely to contain problematic content.\n",
